## Manual testing
#### This is a collection of the manual tests for this project.
#
**TO BE UPDATED**
#
1. Verify that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK) for a successful GET request.
#

2. Check if the API returns the expected data format (e.g., JSON, XML) in the response.
#
3. Ensure that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) for an invalid request.
#
4. Test if the API returns the correct data when querying with specific filters or search criteria.
#
5. Verify that the API returns paginated results when a large number of records are requested.
#
6. Check if the API handles special characters and non-English text correctly in input data and returned responses.
#
7. Test the API’s response when sending concurrent requests to ensure that it can handle multiple users and maintain data consistency.
#
8. Test if the API correctly handles different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint and returns appropriate status codes and responses for each method.
#
9. Check if the API correctly handles updates to existing records, ensuring that changes are saved and reflected in subsequent requests.
#
10. Test the API’s performance under heavy load, simulating a large number of users making requests simultaneously.
#
11. Verify that the API can recover gracefully from failures, such as database connection issues without compromising data integrity.
#
12. Test the API’s ability to handle edge cases, such as requests with missing or invalid parameters, and ensure that appropriate error messages are returned.
#
13. Verify that the API correctly implements rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse or excessive use of resources.
