## Automated testing
#### This is a collection of the automated tests for this project.
#
**TO BE UPDATED**
#
## 1. Validate that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK) for a successful GET request.

#
## 2. Verify that the API returns the expected data format (e.g., JSON, XML) in the response.
#
## 3. Ensure that the API returns the correct HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) for an invalid requests.
#
## 4. Create an automated test that sends a request with specific filters or search criteria and checks if the API returns the correct data.
#
## 5. Write an automated test to verify that the API returns paginated results when a large number of records are requested.
#
## 6. Test if the API handles special characters and non-English text correctly in input data and returned responses using an automated testing tool.
#
## 7. Develop an automated test that sends concurrent requests to the API to ensure that it can handle multiple users and maintain data consistency.
#
## 8. Create an automated test and test if the API correctly handles different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each endpoint and returns appropriate status codes and responses for each method.
#
## 9. Write an automated test to check if the API correctly handles updates to existing records, ensuring that changes are saved and reflected in subsequent requests.
#
## 10. Design an automated performance test that simulates a large number of users making requests simultaneously to check the APIâ€™s performance under heavy load.
#
## 11. Create an automated test that verifies the API can recover gracefully from failures, such as database connection issues or third-party service outages, without compromising data integrity.
#
## 12. Develop an automated test to handle edge cases, such as requests with missing or invalid parameters, and ensure that appropriate error messages are returned.
#
## 13. Write an automated test to verify that the API correctly implements any rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse or excessive use of resources.
